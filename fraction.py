"""
This file contains definition of a fraction class.

You should put complete class here. It must be named `Fragion` and must have the following properties:

- four basic mathematical operators defined;
- elegant conversion to string in the form '3/2';
- simplification and clean-up on construction: both attribute divided by the greatest common divisor
  sign in the nominator, denominator not zero (ValueError should be raised in such case), both attributes
  must be integers (ValueError if not),
- method `value` returning float value of the fraction.
